The novel was published by Bantam Books in October 1978, shortly after the release of the film. It was a commercial success, selling over 3 million copies worldwide. It is now considered a rare and collectible item, as it has been out of print for many years. However, some digital copies can be found online for free download or streaming on sites like Archive.org[^1^] [^2^] and Academia.edu[^3^]. The novel is a must-read for fans of the Halloween franchise, as it offers a deeper insight into the mind and motives of one of the most iconic horror villains of all time.

The novel has received mostly positive reviews from readers and critics, who praised Richards' writing style, atmosphere, and characterization. Many reviewers noted that the novel added more depth and complexity to the film, while still maintaining its suspense and terror. Some of the common themes that reviewers highlighted were:
 
- The prologue that explains the origin of Michael's evil and his connection to an ancient Celtic cult that worshipped Samhain, the lord of death[^1^] [^2^].
- The psychic bond between Michael and Laurie, which hints at their sibling relationship that was revealed in the sequel[^1^] [^2^].
- The different masks that Michael wears throughout the novel, such as a clown mask, a Frankenstein mask, and a skull mask[^2^] [^3^].
- The psychological profiles of Michael and Dr. Loomis, which explore their motivations and conflicts[^1^] [^3^].

Some reviewers also criticized some aspects of the novel, such as the slow pace, the excessive exposition, the deviation from the film's plot, and the loss of mystery and ambiguity that made the film so effective[^2^] [^3^]. However, most reviewers agreed that the novel was a worthwhile companion to the film and a satisfying horror read.

The novel also differs from the film in some significant ways, such as:

- The novel reveals that Michael Myers was born on Halloween night in 1957, and that his mother had a difficult pregnancy and a painful delivery. She also had a vision of a dark figure holding a knife while giving birth[^1^].
- The novel includes a scene where Michael kills a nurse at the mental institution by stabbing her with a knitting needle. He then steals her car and drives away, leaving Dr. Loomis to discover the body[^1^].
- The novel describes Michael's appearance in more detail, such as his pale skin, black hair, and dark eyes. It also mentions that he has a scar on his left cheek from when he stabbed his sister Judith[^2^].
- The novel has more scenes of Michael stalking and killing other people in Haddonfield, such as a mechanic, a dog, and a couple who live next door to the Wallace house[^2^].
- The novel ends with Dr. Loomis shooting Michael six times and then setting him on fire with a flare gun. Michael's body is then taken away by an ambulance, but Loomis suspects that he is still alive[^2^].

These differences add more depth and variety to the novel, but they also change some of the aspects that made the film so effective, such as the simplicity, ambiguity, and realism of the story.
